The goal of this projects is to make this responsive as well as to customize the recipes.  Ideally, I would like to add a selector menu so users can select a menu by their mood or need: comfort, healthyish, vegan, party


Questions:
1. doesn’t appear to be acting fully responsively - why?
2. pics in CSS rather than HTML - is that right?  Don’t recipe pics have meaning for screen readers?
-is that why I have to give them some size for them to show up?
-is the size preventing the pic and basic recipe info from wrapping for small devices?
3. font doesn’t seem to be acting responsive - why?
