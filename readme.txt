The goal of this projects is to make this responsive as well as to customize the recipes.  Ideally, I would like to add a selector menu so users can select a menu by their mood or need: comfort, healthyish, vegan, party


Questions:
2. pics in CSS rather than HTML - is that right?  Donâ€™t recipe pics have meaning for screen readers?
-is that why I have to give them some size for them to show up?
